### Rossmann Store Sales : 

We participated in the Rossmann Store Sales competition at Kaggle. Our goal is to predict Rossman’s ​daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality.
